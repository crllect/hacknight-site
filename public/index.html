				While sleep deprived, people may experience a phenomenon called
				"microsleeps" where they fall asleep for a few seconds without
				realizing it. This is totally unrelated, but I thought it was
				interesting.
				<br />
				<br />
				What exactly is Meta Prompting? well, I dont actually know. I
				made it up two seconds ago, but this website is about stupid
				sidequests, and I think this is a pretty stupid sidequest.
				<br />
				<br />
				In summary, OpenAI's GPT-3 is a very powerful language model
				that can generate text based on a prompt. Now, for our hackathon
				project, I wrote a backend to use OpenAI's GPT-3. Now,
				<br />
				<br />
				I had no idea how to prompt the AI, so I openned an instance of
				Copilot, in order to generate a prompt for GPT-3. This would
				work perfectly, if it wernt for the fact that nothing can ever
				work the first time.
				<br />
				<br />
				Copilot infomred me that it could only help with coding related
				activities. This, feels a little strange, but its whatever. I
				have another trick up my sleeve, BingAI. I prompted BingAI for
				help on prompting GPT-3.
				<br />
				<br />
				Then I rememered, BingAI sucks. So I asked BingAI how to bypass
				Copilot's restrictions. BingAI told me and it helped me somewhat
				suprisingly.
				<br />
				<br />
				After bypassing Copilots restrictions with BingAI, I was finally
				able to prompt GPT-3, with a Copilot generated prompt. After
				several minutes of terible output I wrote it myself.
